## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   You will need a **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 2. Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/joe-watkins/kfdb.git
    cd kfdb
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Provide API Key:**
    The application uses Vite and is configured to read the Gemini API key from an environment variable `VITE_API_KEY`.

    For local development:
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root
    - Add your Gemini API key:
      ```
      VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
      ```

    For production deployment on platforms like Netlify, set the `VITE_API_KEY` environment variable in your project settings.

    **IMPORTANT**: This is **not secure** for a public repository. The `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing it. If you deploy this project, you must use your hosting provider's system (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Google Cloud) to manage environment variables securely.

### 3. Running the Application

This project uses Vite as its build tool and development server.

1.  Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

### 4. Building for Production

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized assets in the `dist` directory, which can be deployed to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## üîí Security

**NEVER commit your API key to a public Git repository.**

The project is set up with:
1. Environment variables using Vite's `.env` file system
2. A `.gitignore` file that excludes the `.env` file containing your API key
3. Configuration in `vite.config.ts` to properly expose the environment variable to your application

For production environments, always use a secure method for handling environment variables provided by your hosting platform (such as Netlify's environment variable settings).
