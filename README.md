## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   You will need a **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 2. Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Provide API Key:**
    The application is configured to read the Gemini API key from an environment variable `process.env.API_KEY`. In a simple static project setup like this (without a build tool like Vite or Next.js), you'll need to make this variable available to the browser's execution context.

    For local development, the simplest way is to replace `process.env.API_KEY` in `services/geminiService.ts` with your actual key as a string.

    **IMPORTANT**: This is **not secure** for a public repository or production. If you deploy this project, you must use your hosting provider's system (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Google Cloud) to manage environment variables securely.

### 3. Running the Application

This project is a static site that uses ES modules via an `importmap`. You can run it with any simple local web server. The easiest way is using `npx serve`.

1.  Install `serve` if you haven't already:
    ```sh
    npm install -g serve
    ```

2.  Run the server from the project's root directory:
    ```sh
    serve
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by the server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## üîí Security

**NEVER commit your API key to a public Git repository.**

If you follow the local development instructions and hard-code your key, be sure not to commit that change. For production environments, always use a secure method for handling environment variables provided by your hosting platform.
